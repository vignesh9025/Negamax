# Negamax

An AI that plays the Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Negamax algorithm.

---

## About

This project demonstrates the implementation of the following algorithms:

    1. Negamax
    2. Negamax with Iterative-Deepening
    3. Negamax with Iterative-Deepening and Alpha-Beta Pruning

We create a class for a Tic-Tac-Toe game, and try out these methodologies with different Tic-Tac-Toe games. Additionally, we build a function using which we compare and analyze the results. We also implement another game to try the algorithms on, and synthesize a new opponent for playing Tic-Tac-Toe with.

This project was implemented as a part of the CS440: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at Colorado State University, during the Fall of 2017.
